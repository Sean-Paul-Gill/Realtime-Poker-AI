The hand-evaluation folder was used to simulate all possible hands against each other. 
This is useful for when we need to construct a range for someone against a specific amount of players. 
**For Example:** Player A plays to the 20% of hands. His range is constructed different given the position he is in. Using this hand-evaluation scripts we can distinguish the top 20% of hands and export them to a numpy array.
